# **NETFLIX MOVIES AND TV SHOWS CLUSTERING**

## **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing the Netflix dataset of movies and TV shows until 2019. The goal is to uncover insights, trends, and patterns within the dataset and develop a content-based recommender system using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## **DATASET**

The dataset used for this analysis is the [Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tTe_ZNRN5WZ8JTUOej5-v4WzE6ymoeaS/view?usp=drive_link). It provides comprehensive information on Netflix content until 2019.


## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Explore the Netflix dataset to gain insights into the content available on the platform, identify content availability in different countries, analyze Netflix's focus on TV shows vs. movies, and cluster similar content for building a recommender system.

## **PROJECT SUMMARY**

The project involves handling missing values, dealing with nested columns, rating binning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), cluster creation, dimensionality reduction, and building a content-based recommender system. The aim is to enhance the user experience through personalized recommendations.

## **ENHANCING YOUR NETFLIX EXPERIENCE!**

We've deployed a Netflix recommendation system, providing personalized content suggestions. The system runs on your local server, interacts with users in real-time, and uses natural language processing for content-based recommendations.
